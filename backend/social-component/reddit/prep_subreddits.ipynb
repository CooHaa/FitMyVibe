      "Description\n",
      "Also known as dealer boots, the Chelsea boots are tight fitting ankle length boots with low heels. They consist of two parts each made from a single piece of leather: the vamp and the quarters which meet near the ankle where they are joined by a strip of vulcanized rubber or elastic.  The elastic strip extends to just below the ankle but does not go all the way down to the sole. Instead of being sewn on top of each other, the vamp and quarters are sewn together in one plain below the ankle. The Chelsea boots have rounded toes just like the Jodhpur boots but the sewing techniques on them totally distinguish them.\n",
      "History\n",
      "The boot has Victorian roots to it. Its design and invention is attributed to J.Sparkes Hall the boot maker to Queen Victoria. Thanks to the inventor of the process of rubber vulcanization, J.Sparkes created a boot that could be easily slipped on and off. He was the first person to make an elastic sided ankle boot. The Chelsea boots were originally both men and women’s shoes. It is believed that the shoes were first used for walking and then later on used for horse riding. The boots made several appearances in movies and celebrity outfits like that of the Beatles. This made them become even more popular.\n",
      "Present Chelsea boots\n",
      "Today, the Chelsea boots are still considered as a classic piece due to their simple yet stylish appearance.  It is hardly impossible to go wrong with these boots. They can be dressed up, down and back again. The boots are a priceless item and exude class, charm and signal heritage.\n",
      "How to wear them\n",
      "The Chelsea boots are versatile, meaning that they be worn with both formal and casual attires.\n",
      "\tBlack Chelsea boots match perfectly with black and grey slim suits, chinos and flat front trousers. \n",
      "\tThe brown Chelsea boots would work with navy or grey suits, straight leg jeans.\n",
      "\tBulky Chelsea boots can be teamed up with boot cut jeans because of their size and are suitable for outdoor events and activities.\n",
      "\tThe short Chelsea boots are suitable for those who love the casual chic look. The boots are however slightly different from regular Chelsea boots. They are usually a little shorter, with their length coming up to just below the ankle.\n",
      "\tWingtip Chelsea boots can be worn with both jeans and formal attires. A hacking jacket or a tweed sports coat also nicely compliments the boots.\n",
      "With a variety of designs and colors, the Chelsea boots leave you spoilt for choice on which to for. They are all very fashionable and let you easily pull of your desired look. This a secret for that easy man that still wants to easily achieve the perfect look as they are very easy to match up.\n",
