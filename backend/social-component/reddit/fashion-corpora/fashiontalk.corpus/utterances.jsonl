I realized this amid a bowl a fine herb and became perplexed by this meta truth. Most things in life tend to serve more as a means than an end, and things that serve only unto them selves (\"meta-means\") tend to be destructive in nature such as power and money.\nSo that got me thinking. What does fashion truly express? I refuse to accept that it is a meta-means. People put hard work, time, thought and extreme dedication into it, too much that the sum of which could ever be trivial. To find my answer i began to think about how we dress. There are occasions such as planned events in which we will premeditate our outfits days maybe even weeks in advance, but most days I would say the average drops down to no more than 12 hours, very commonly, 12 minutes.\nSo in those 12 minutes, just what are we doing while we look through our closets, throwing heaps of clothes onto our beds' that we'll just make a pillow of tonight, ignoring or out right rejecting certain shirts because they don't \"feel right\", or that's not what I'm in the mood for. \nWe are searching for a way to speak to the world.\nEveryday is new, filled with new people, new parties, meet ups, and overall life. Sometimes there's just not enough time to say just what you want to these new strangers, yet we feel like we must say something. We must let them know, show them, tease them maybe, with hints of what lies beneath the skin and eyes.\nIn avlot of ways, your style, your fashion for the day, is more like a photograph than anything else. \nIt represents a snapshot in time, a snapshot of your frame of mind, and in that moment summarizes all of your worries, your non easily explainable wants, your hopes your hesitance, and it funnels that all into a single shirt, much the same way a single photograph does. There are tremendous amounts of details that your subconscious yearns to express to the unknown world outside your door, and i feel like one way people do this, is through fashion.", "meta": {"score": 1, "top_level_comment": null, "retrieved_on": 1441542028, "gilded": 0, "gildings": null, "subreddit": "fashiontalk", "stickied": false, "permalink": "/r/fashiontalk/comments/259v09/what_does_fashion_truly_express/", "author_flair_text": ""}}
