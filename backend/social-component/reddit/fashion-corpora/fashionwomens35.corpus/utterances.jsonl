My friends told me all throughout my teens and 20's that I looked like a 35-year-old. To be honest, I just think I look better in simpler, more classic pieces like button-ups and basic blouses, cardigans, and full-length pants. So unless a trend *really* strikes my fancy (like bow neck blouses or tasteful lace sleeves/yokes over the past few years), I mostly stick to my basics. \n\nI'm personally particularly uncomfortable in trends like super baggy silhouettes, cropped/ankle pants, anything with tons of ruffles or layers that are too feminine for how I see myself, and weird cut-outs like cold shoulder tops.\n\nI think that part of it is that my formative years during and after college were spent tutoring and teaching (thus requiring a modest wardrobe) first in the US and then in rural Japan, where work clothes are very conservative by American standards. I still have it in the back of my head that it's inappropriate to show my ankles, bare shoulders or upper arms, that necklines should be as close to the collar bone as possible, etc. Exposing much more than that just makes me so self-conscious and uncomfortable! Though luckily, I think I look better (and feel more confident) in more conservative outfits, so it works out well.\n\nOn the other hand, as long as other people look more-or-less appropriate for a given venue (ie: no mesh shirts or crop tops at a job interview or parent-teacher conference, please), I really don't mind what other people do style-wise and I think everyone should wear what makes them feel best.

Looking at what worked, with an eye toward next year, I think the key lies in being recognizable without looking like I'm trying to look too young or trendy or sexy.
